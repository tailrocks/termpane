# jackin-term

Owned terminal model for the `jackin-capsule` re-emitting PTY multiplexer.

This crate is the implementation behind the [Capsule Terminal Model][terminal-model].
The README is the engineering record — a cold reader must finish it understanding what problem
we hit, what we tried, what we analyzed, and why we built this. Read it with the terminal-model
reference if you are new to the codebase.

## What problem this solves

`jackin-capsule` is a re-emitting PTY multiplexer. It runs as PID 1 inside a role container,
owns N PTY sessions (one per agent/shell pane), and presents the focused session's screen to
whatever host terminal the operator attached — possibly over SSH. To do this it must:

1. **Parse** raw bytes from each agent's PTY (escape sequences, UTF-8, cursor moves, colors,
   scroll regions, OSC passthrough, wide chars).
2. **Maintain** an in-memory cell grid — so it can repaint the screen on focus changes,
   resize events, and after dialog overlays close.
3. **Emit** only the changed cells as a minimal escape byte sequence to the host terminal.
   On SSH links where bandwidth matters, emitting the full screen every frame is unacceptable.

The **hot path** is: present the focused pane every render tick (~33 ms), emit only what changed.

---

## What we used before, and the exact problems we hit

`jackin-capsule` was built on `vt100` (Jesse Luehrs / `doy`), a fork pinned at a SHA:

```toml
vt100 = { git = "https://github.com/donbeave/vt100-rust", rev = "527f0715..." }
```

The `TODO.md` historically called this a temporary bridge. The June 2026 audit established the
truth is worse:

1. **We never used `vt100`'s emit.** `rg "contents_diff|contents_formatted" crates/jackin-capsule/src`
   returns **nothing**. The defining feature of `vt100` — "diff two screens, serialize to escapes"
   — is dead code for us. We replaced it with our own snapshot+diff+emit in
   `crates/jackin-capsule/src/tui/render.rs` because `vt100`'s emit knows nothing about our
   pane offsets, borders, or dialog overlays.

2. **`vt100` exposes no damage.** To find what changed, our `render.rs` re-reads and re-diffs
   **the entire grid** every frame — O(rows × cols) even when 3 lines changed. This is because
   `vt100` has no damage-tracking API; damage must be recomputed from a full snapshot compare.

3. **A heap `String` allocated per non-blank cell per frame.** `cell.contents().to_string()` in
   `render.rs`. A tall pane = thousands of `String`s allocated and dropped every 33 ms even
   when nothing changed. This is `vt100`'s representation choice: cells store graphemes as owned
   `String`s rather than interned or packed.

4. **Two grids that drift.** The old `vt100` path paired a terminal snapshot with separate
   render-side pane-body diff state. When they disagreed (resize, reflow, filter — Defect 44),
   stale cells appeared on screen as ghost rows.

5. **Upstream is effectively abandoned.** Last *substantive* PR merged: April 2023. As of June 2026:
   10 open PRs (oldest from January 2021), 8 of them opened Dec 2025–May 2026 — zero merged.
   Our `clear_scrollback` patch is PR #31, open since May 22 2026, unmerged. The fork is permanent.

## What we analyzed (the full survey)

| Candidate | Parser | Damage | Packed cells | Passthrough | Diff-to-escape | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `vt100` (fork) | own SM | **none** | `String`/cell | `Callbacks` (forked) | ✓ (unused) | Retired; wrong shape |
| `vte` alone | ✓ | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | Parser only; always depend |
| `alacritty_terminal` | `vte` | ✓ line-level | ✓ packed | GPU-shaped | **none** | Grid+damage fit; passthrough gap |
| `termwiz` / `wezterm-term` | own | ✓ (`Change`) | partial | ✓ | ✓ (unused for us) | Too broad; unstable pub API |
| Rio / `copa` | own | unknown | unknown | unknown | n/a | Very low adoption; not evaluated |
| `avt` | own | none | n/a | none | none | Snapshot-only; not a grid |
| libvterm | C library | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **Ruled out: non-Rust.** See constraint. |
| Ghostty / Alacritty (full) | `vte` / own | ✓ | ✓ packed | partial | GPU only | GPU-first; wrong output stage for us |
| Zellij's `grid` | own | ✓ per-row | ✓ | partial | own | Closest design; not published |

**Key finding:** the "fast engines have no diff-to-escape" argument that originally dismissed
`alacritty_terminal` is a **strawman for our case** — we own our emit already. What we need from
a grid crate is **damage + packed cells**, and there `alacritty_terminal` is strong while `vt100`
is the weakest option.

---

## What we tried before building

**Baseline audit (June 2026):** mapped every `vt100` call site in `crates/jackin-capsule/src`.
Found we use the grid (cell read), geometry, modes, scrollback, and `Callbacks` — never the emit.
Confirmed the per-cell `String` alloc and the O(grid) snapshot rebuild by reading `render.rs`.

**`alacritty_terminal` buy path:** evaluated as a grid+damage source while keeping jackin's
emit. The grid ideas remain useful references, but the public API is not shaped for a stable
multiplexer-facing dependency.

**`termwiz` buy path:** confirmed `wezterm-term` is not a separately published crate and
`termwiz` is broader than the narrow terminal-model surface jackin-capsule needs.

---

## Why we decided to build, and why it's better here

The operator decision (June 2026): **quality/perf/stability are the goals; cost/time/maintenance
are not constraints.** Owning the layer is the only path where:

- The API is our nouns, shaped for a re-emitting mux (not a GPU renderer).
- It never breaks under `cargo update`.
- Passthrough is first-class (typed `PassthroughEvents`), not a callback shim on someone else's API.
- Damage is recorded at mutation time, collapsing the two-grid drift that causes Defect 44's
  resize-ghost class **structurally** — not with workarounds.
- Zero per-frame allocation is achievable with a packed cell and a reused emit buffer.

## What we depend on vs re-implement (the borrow ledger)

| Source | What we take | How | License | Attribution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `vte` | VT/ANSI parser state machine | **Depend** — never rebuild | MIT | `vte` crate, doy |
| Ghostty `PageList` | Arena-page memory model for a future cell-grid rewrite if live RSS/CPU proves the current model is the bottleneck | **Reference / future re-implementation candidate** | MIT | Ghostty project, Mitchell Hashimoto |
| Alacritty ring-`Storage` | Ring-backed row storage for primary, alternate, and scrollback rows | **Re-implemented** / reference | Apache-2.0/MIT | Alacritty project |

Every STORE/BORROW site carries an attribution comment in the source naming the project + license.
`vte` is the only parser dependency; everything else is re-implemented code or committed corpus
coverage with an inline comment pointing at the original where applicable.

## Architecture and design invariants

```
vte (dep)           ← parse: bytes → Perform events
   ↓
DamageGrid (build)  ← shared RowArena + ring-backed RowStore,
   │                    CompactString cell contents, scrollback
   │  dirty_spans() ← damage recorded AS Perform mutates (not recomputed by re-read)
   ↓
PassthroughEvents   ← typed: title/clipboard/kitty/focus/OSC-7/csi/scrollback-clear
   ↓
SocketBackend       ← focused live GridPatch rows encode directly; complex frames use Ratatui
                      full clear on geometry change (Defect 44 invariant)
```

**Invariants:**
- Every geometry change fully covers each rect: after any resize, the next full frame clears
  the terminal buffer and repaints through `PaneBodyWidget`/`SocketBackend`. No stale cell
  should survive a frame.
- Damage recorded at mutation, not recomputed by re-read.
- Zero per-frame heap allocation in the `process()` + borrowed `dump_dirty_patch()` path after
  warmup; the complete capsule focused-render handoff is tracked by the live acceptance ledger.
- Minimal wire bytes for focused live pane output come from jackin-term dirty patches encoded
  directly by `SocketBackend`; complex full/chrome/dialog frames use Ratatui over the same backend.
- Pure Rust, no foreign bindings, no C/Zig libraries.

## How correctness is guaranteed

1. **Conformance replay harness** (`tests/conformance.rs`): feeds identical byte streams to
   `DamageGrid` in one chunk and byte-by-byte, then asserts identical final grids plus cursor,
   geometry, wide-cell, style, and alt-screen invariants. This proves parser carry state is
   deterministic across PTY read boundaries without carrying a second terminal model.
2. **Conformance corpus** (`tests/fixtures/`): vttest/esctest sequences, real `claude`/`codex`/
   `vim`/`htop`/`tmux` PTY captures, asciinema casts, pathological sets (`yes`, `seq 1 100000`,
   full-screen redraw storms).
3. **Fuzz target** (`fuzz/src/damage_grid_process.rs`): feeds arbitrary bytes to the parser and
   asserts zero panics plus one-shot vs byte-split determinism.
4. **Golden wire-emit snapshots** (Phase 2+): byte-exact emit snapshots for representative frames
   including resize/shrink, locking the Defect 44 erase-to-EOL contract.
5. **Round-trip property test** (Phase 2+): "any mutation sequence → full re-emit → reproduces
   the ground-truth grid."

`vt100` is fully retired from this crate: no production dependency, dev-dependency, fuzz
dependency, benchmark baseline, or source-policy exception remains.

## Pure-Rust, no-foreign-bindings constraint

This crate contains no `unsafe` code, no FFI, no C/Zig dependencies. The build has no non-Rust
build dependency. Non-Rust terminal emulators (libvterm, Ghostty) appear in the analysis above as
**design references only** — their algorithms are re-implemented in Rust with attribution.

## Host-side effects: None

`jackin-term` is a library with no host-side effects. It does not write to the filesystem, make
network calls, or mutate host state. All mutation is in-memory, scoped to the `DamageGrid` and
`PassthroughEvents` types.
