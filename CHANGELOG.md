## [0.6.4] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Extracted from the [`jackin-project/jackin`](https://github.com/jackin-project/jackin) monorepo, where the crate lived as `crates/jackin-term` (the owned terminal model of the jackin❯ Capsule PTY multiplexer). History preserved via `git filter-repo`.
- Renamed the crate `jackin-term` → `termpane` (lib `jackin_term` → `termpane`).
- No behavior changes: this is the first standalone release, bit-identical in logic to the monorepo source at extraction.
